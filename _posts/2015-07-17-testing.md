#This is a test.

Number: 17


I'm trying to figure out code highlighting with Jekyll and pygment.

Does this work?

```
if (i<j) {
dosomething();
}
```

Or what about this?

```
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
```

what about this other little test right here?

```

var num = 0;

process.argv.forEach(function(val, index, array) {
	if (index >= 2) {
            num += + val;
        }
} );

console.log(num);

```

Then why not this???

```
var num = 0;

process.argv.forEach(function(val, index, array) {
	if (index >= 2) {
            num += + val;
        }
} );

console.log(num);
```
